/*
Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

Example:

Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
*/
func sortColors(nums []int) {

	var low, mid int
	high := len(nums) - 1

	for mid <= high {
		if nums[mid] == 0 {
			nums[mid], nums[low] = nums[low], nums[mid]
			low++
			mid++
		} else if nums[mid] == 1 {
			mid++
		} else {
			nums[mid], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[mid]
			high--
		}
	}
}
